Long gone are the days of plucking fruits from wild shrubs and trees. Fading from memory are the hot afternoons spent clearing the farm of weeds and making ridges. In hindsight, traction engines and large stationary threshers are only museum pieces now. Today, the tractor is king, the combine is a prince with powerful arms; solutions to all the grower's problems. Tomorrow, drones will rule the farm and get everything monitored and corrected in real time. Data is king and the farm is no exception!

This article highlights various advances in different spheres of agricultural practice.
While many developing countries are still battling with ‘tractorization’ and mechanization of agricultural operations, in more advanced climes technological innovation has made exponential growth in agriculture possible. Improved varieties of crops, disease resistant and high yielding varieties are all results of this development. Research institutes play a major role in the development of agriculture across the globe. Vitamin A cassava, a variety that was researched and propagated in Nigeria has contributed to stemming the tide of vitamin A deficiency in children and pregnant women in the country (Harvest Plus, 2014).

Integrated farming has reduced space requirements and made it possible to have greater yields on smaller hectarage. Precision and irrigated farming have enhanced resource control on- farm and improved conservation of inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Technology has made remote sensing possible for farm operations, harvesting, and processing of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging are now applied in agriculture, leading to improved prediction and precision in harvesting, processing, and storage. ‘Smart-farms’ is currently a buzzword but the economies of scale still require that products from these outfits are exported and sold abroad in order to quickly recoup the higher investment cost. It is a growing trend and one to be invested in.

To help achieve targets on the farm using technology, simulation software for process design and prediction of possible yield patterns and outputs based on known factors can be employed. These predictions can only be relied upon when factors such as rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature can be controlled and not left to chance. Vertical farming, greenhouse farming, use of screen houses and “smart farms” provide a great opportunity for year-round cultivation of crops. The applicability of modern technology on a local basis should be the focus of upcoming Ag Engineers and researchers.

For land-based agricultural practices, numerous farm settlements abound in Nigeria, however, it is important that the technical manpower directly involved in agriculture be invested in, the enabling environment made available and the disparity between urban and rural areas especially in the areas of amenities such as electricity, water, suitable housing, and good road network be reduced so as to grow the population of the youth engaged in agriculture in Nigeria. The vast arable land available in the country can be utilized as a means of increasing the hectarage under cultivation and reducing fragmented holdings.
